    "The goal is to investigate which supervised mahine learning methods will give the best results in classifying the texts from our dataset into the pre-defined categories. This is a multi-class text classification problem. The input will be the text elements of each conversation concatenated together. The output will be the instruction_id."

Each conversation falls into one of six domains: ordering pizza, creating auto repair appointments, setting up ride service, ordering movie tickets, ordering coffee drinks and making restaurant reservations. Our initial data exploration will use the written dialog file with 7,708 records."

    "- __Feature Engineering:__\n",
    "    - Count Vectors: \n",
    "    Count Vector is a matrix notation of the dataset in which every row represents a document from the corpus, every column represents a term from the corpus, and every cell represents the frequency count of a particular term in a particular document. These provide no context, nor any consideration of the words in relation to other words or position in the sentence.\n",
    "        - Bag-of-words\n",
    "        - Bag of n-grams\n",
    "    - TF-IDF Vectors: \n",
    "    TF-IDF score represents the relative importance of a term in the document and the entire corpus. TF-IDF score is composed by two terms: the first computes the normalized Term Frequency (TF), the second term is the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.\n",
    "        - Word level Tfidf\n",
    "        - N-gram Level TF-IDF\n",
    "    - Word Embeddings:\n",
    "    A word embedding is a form of representing words and documents using a dense vector representation. The position of a word within the vector space is learned from text and is based on the words that surround the word when it is used. These generate a context free representation of each word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "        - Word2vec\n",
    "        - Glove\n",
    "    - NLP Based features: \n",
    "    An example of this would be Frequency distribution of Part of Speech Tags.\n",
    "        - Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun Counts\n",
    "    - Language Models:\n",
    "    These are recent breakthroughs that provide context and generate a representation of each word based on other words in the sentence.\n",
    "        - BERT or FLAIR\n",
    "- __Model Training:__\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes (multinominal): the one most suitable for word counts is multinominal.\n",
    "    - logistic regression.\n",
    "    - support vector machine.\n",
